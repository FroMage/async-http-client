Roadmap for 1.0.0
-----------------

P1 [Must Have]
---------------
    + Add SSL support [Support Added March 18]
    + Expose ByteBuffer to Handler (or some new Handler)
    + annotated-client support
    + Replace Log4J with our own logging interface and add instantiable adapters to the various loggers which can be set on the client instance. (offer a public interface user can implement to support their favorite logger. Default JDK)
    + Proper connection pool 
    + Support for arbitrary HTTP verbs and all the defined one.
    + Stable release of Netty 3.2
    + Javadoc for the public API.
    + Decent unit test coverage
    + Remove the check for POST/PUT to the body handling which goes some way toward arbitrary http verbs and more efficient PUTs.
    + Callback during request transmission
    + Support InputStream for PUT operation
    +  

P2 [May Have]
--------------
    + CacheControl helpers -- ie, translate cache-control and/or last modified information into easy to use cache semantics
    + Possibly a read-through cache with pluggable providers (in-memory, memcached, etc
    + Support for pipelining on a connection Possibly we want to submit Request to a pool and have the pool decide which connection to dispatch on, ie use a free one if avail, otherwise pipeline on an pipelinable connection.
    + Build not dependent of internet connection  

P3 [Community contributions]
----------------------------

    + Support commonj work manager as well for threading
    + Support NTLM Auth
    + curl like command line support
